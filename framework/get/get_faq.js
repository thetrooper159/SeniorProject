/****************************************

For Getting Information for the faq page

This is a great example module on sql queries for data. 

The tables used are faq and faq_sections. 
faq_sections have an Id and title
faq has Id, section_Id, question, answer, and Order

The faq table is going connecting to the faq_sections through the section_Id column which will match the Id column in faq_sections

In this, we will have different functions that return values for each section.


For this to work correctly you will have to understand callbacks which is a tricky concecpt to pick up
